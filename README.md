I'm attending a hackathon focused on maps, satellite imagery, and real-world data. I’m thinking of designing a small multiplayer Twitch game where students compete in an artillery-code tournament: each team writes the code that fires their shots.

Gameplay ideas:
* Each shot is defined by curved start→end GPS information.
* When a projectile lands, the game reports estimated cost-of-living impact and destruction at that GPS location using real data layers.
* Players receive a post-tournament log summarizing shots, damage, and economic impact.
* The main objective is to be the last team standing, but with rules that discourage reckless or criminal behavior. For example:
  * Firing from or into civilian zones has penalties: your exact position is revealed to opponents (or revealed for 10 seconds if civilians are hit).
  * Any attack that harms civilians temporarily exposes the attacker’s position to others.
* The mechanic encourages tactical play: operating inside civilian areas increases the risk of being tracked.
  
The topic of the hackathon is use the satellite date and not make a game.  
So I am going to make a mini game then learn on the hackathon how to design the log based on sponsor data.

**Note of a fun idea:** ArtilleryAgar.IO  
You start small and every time you reach a target you win in power destruction and range but move slower.
